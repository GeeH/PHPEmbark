## Initial syllabus outline

1. Basic PHP

    Basic PHP should start with "hello world" and the change/refresh cycle
    then basic variables (container for a value)

    Then on to:

    1. booleans, numbers and math
    2. strings and string functions
    3. scalar vs. complex types and juggling types
    3. basic arrays
    4. basic objects
    5. logic - if, else, foreach, for, while
    6. basic functions
    7. basic classes

1. basic internet (http, request, response, basic html)

    After "this is PHP" we should get into "this is the web"

    1. HTTP, sockets, what the internet is and how it works in basic terms
    2. request -> response and PHP (shared nothing)
    3. basic html (here is your template for future pages)
    4. PHP speaks http! (POST and GET and a sidenote on redirects)

1. forms

    Now we get into forms

    1. basic forms (var dump our data)
    1. basic security (all people are evil cats)
    1. check input (validate)
    1. escape output and separation of concerns
    1. populating forms, errors, redirecting


1. sqlite and databases

    Databases!

    Use - pdo? or sqlite3?

    how much of db to do?

1. crud

    and then basic "write crud"
