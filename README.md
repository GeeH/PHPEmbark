# PHPEmbark

PHPEmbark is an open source, accessible introduction to PHP for beginners.

No previous programming experience for students is required, and the teaching methods may not work as well for those with previous programming experience.

This is not designed for "self" teaching, but around the concept of one or more instructors (either in person or using virtual tools) who are familar with the concepts leading the learning.

The curriculum is designed around a learning cycle of theory, example, practice, and application.

This means a lesson begins with introduction of a theory, moves on to showing a practical example, the students perform one or more practice exercises, and then the newly aquired knowledge is applied toward building a practical application that can be run by the student.

The sections are structured with "The Lego Rule" in mind - concepts are taught one at a time, and build on each other to expand knowledge, with an absolute minimum of "handwaving" or "magic" - "Just do it this way it's magic"

## Requirements

- A computer running Windows 7 or 8, OS X 10.6 or newer, or a Linux variant (we will assume Ubuntu Desktop for the purposes of this course)
- The ability to navigate the filesystem, including creating and deleting files and folders
- The ability to download and install software on your computer

## Software used

* [PHP 5.6](http://php.net)
    - We'll be using the built-in development HTTP server on port 8080
    - We will use SQLite databases
    - We will use PDO for database communication
* [Komodo Edit](http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/)
    - Komodo Edit is free, open source code editor that runs on all three platforms we are supporting
    - This exact tool is not a hard requirement, if students already have a text editor or IDE capable of PHP, html, and css highlighting and preferably with autocomplete for PHP, that known tool can be used instead for file editing.
* A web browser, like Firefox or Google Chrome
* [sqlite browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
 - Free Open source GUI for dealing with sqlite databases that runs on all three platforms we are supporting
 
All windows software will be available as a portable install - simply drop the file in place and double click the included .bat file
Install files will also be available for windows for those wishing permanent installs of the software used.
Sofware on (ubuntu) linux is installable with easily available packages
Easy installers are available for the sofware tools on mac as well, for php upgrades to 5.6 possibly use http://php-osx.liip.ch

## Teacher and Student Downloads
Eventually we will have ready to go downloads for teachers (slides, how to present tips, handouts for printing, and helper notes), and students (examples, exercises, handouts for viewing)
