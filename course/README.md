# Course Syllabus

Except for the Introduction and Setup, which should run no more than 10 or 15 minutes each section of is designed to be a 2 hour course, with a logical break halfway.

Each section provides materials for presenting (slides with notes) for teachers, handouts (written materials suitable for printing out or reading on screen) for students, a directory of exercises to enhance learning, and a directory with a hands on exercise that will lead to a practical application of the new skill in an overall project.

There are 8 sections - 16 hours of teaching material, and that barely scratches the surface of all there is to be learned in programming PHP.

This can be taught over multiple days or weeks in one or two hour sessions, or in day long workshops typical of conferences.

Only the first half is currently completed
