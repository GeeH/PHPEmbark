# Course Syllabus

Except for the Introduction and Setup, which should run no more than 10 or 15 minutes each section of is designed to be a 2 hour course, with a logical break halfway.

Each section provides materials for presenting (slides with notes) for teachers, handouts (written materials suitable for printing out or reading on screen) for students, a directory of exercises to enhance learning, and a directory with a hands on exercise that will lead to a practical application of the new skill in an overall project.

There are 8 sections - 16 hours of teaching material, and that barely scratches the surface of all there is to be learned in programming PHP.

This can be taught over multiple days or weeks in one or two hour sessions, or in day long workshops typical of conferences.

Only the first half is currently completed

### Idea outline:

1. open source slides (do we have a format preference for this?  some
like powerpoint, some keynote, there are other solutions, but whatever
we use needs to be simple) in one hour "block" setups with notes for
presenters/teachers to use  - this will allow the talks to be done as
a "series" at usergroups, tutorials and workshops at conferences, and
even online via online presentation methods

For now I'm just doing powerpoint slides - they are really simple and can be exported to other formats, but it's important to have the original version available for editing

In additional all code shown should have available .php files in examples directories

2. written handout/textbook style information for learners - basically written versions of the slides

3. quiz/exercise style questions to "solve" - to practice new skills -
possibly with example solutions or even without

4. Practical usage that when put together creates a completed application

The practical part will probably need to be written BACKWARDS - since
we'll have a final simplistic application that then gets torn apart to
learn little pieces at a time.  I'd like to keep the
javascript/css/html burden to as little as possible, although if
someone with more design skills would like to provide a "plug and
play" solution for adding pretty design to our finished practical app,
that's fine.

As for what to write as the final practial application I don't really
care too much.  I was considering a simple user free form diary.  Then
we could implement a single user login/logout, posting of content,
getting of content in list and single entry format.  And it would be
just fine with sqlite as the db :)

Best practices should be shown always (you teach sql use + prepared
statements, htmlentities with $_GET and $_POST) but stay away from
additional complex concepts

since we're already teaching
http and internet
php programming
sql
very basic mvc/project layout

we need to attempt to keep the "learning load" down

Part 2 will be additional load and not finished right away
version control
cli
javascript
composer and library usage
advanced OOP
advanced html/css

later we can add those as additional things to learn
