## Lesson 2 - Data Models and Validation

## Practical Application

We've gone over several concepts

### Extending PDO

Exercise 1:

1. Create a class that extends PDO
2. Create a constructor that manipulates arguments into a new dsn
3. Create a "helper" function that will store all queries sent to pdo
4. Create a "helper" function that will retreive those stored queries
    - how could this help with debugging or making database queries work better?

### Writing Database Access Objects

Exercise 2:

1. Create your own database table sql with 2 columns
2. Create a CRUD database access class for your new database table

### Writing Data Objects

Exercise 3:

1. Create a data object for your new database table
2. Create a validation method for your data object
3. Make your Database Access Object use your new Data Object
